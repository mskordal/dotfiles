# My Neovim configuration
This a personal neovim configuration using several useful plugins such as
telescope or treesitter. To make this, I followed typecraft's tutorial on
[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHTeCSVAFNY&list=PLsz00TDipIffreIaUNk64KxTIkQaGguqn)
and then extended my configuration using the kickstart repository on
[github](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim). Finally I tailored and
added plugins according to my own needs.

## Installation
Copy the directory in `~/.config` and start `nvim`.
